        <h1>About Keys</h1>
        <hr>

        A Key contains a single symmetric cryptographic key.
        Key entries are represented in KeyStore Explorer by the following icon:

        <p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/key_entry.png">

        <p>

        Key entries can be displayed and <a href="deleteKey.html">deleted</a>.

        <p>

        As key entries do not contain any certificates no value is shown for them in the
        <b>Certificate Expiry</b> column of the KeyStore table.
